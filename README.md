What changed based on the lecturers feedback:
This time i did not use AI code. The code works and i spent more time on it. The user is able to add an unlimited number of number of recipes. They can also enter a name for each recipe. A list of all recipes are displayed in alphabetical order by name to the user. Users can choose which recipe to display from the list. For each ingredient, the user can the number of calories and the food group that the ingredient belongs to. The software shall calculate and display the total calories of all the ingredients in the recipe. The user gets notified when the total calories of a recipe exceed 300.
